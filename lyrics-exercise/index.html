    <h3>[Intro]</h3>
    <p>And so I've arrived </br>
    With gold in my eyes</br>
    Are you paying attention?</p>
    
    <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    <p>I was searching for something</br>
    As I watched you run</br>
    I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some<br>
    Were you looking for someone?<br>
    As I watched you go<br>
    I am mad because I don't know what you used me for<br>
    I've been looking for so long<br>
    In Amerika<br>
    Throw my hands in the air</p>

    <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
    <p>Flash faded<br>
    Say you care, but you don't<br>
    You know I hate it<br>
    It's a rich kid game, didn't grow up with a throne<br>
    It's all it really is</p>

    <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    I was searching for something<br>
    As I watched you run<br>
    I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some<br>
    Were you looking for someone?<br>
    As I watched you go<br>
    I am mad because I don't know what you used me for<br>
    Always talking about one day<br>
    In Amerika<br>
    Same old story, oh<br>
    You want glory, son<br>
    I've been looking for so long<br>
    But you cut me out<br>
    Throw my hands in the air 'cause Iâ€”<br>

    <h3>[Verse 2]</h3> 
    Your palace<br>
    All the friends you own<br>
    So jealous<br>
    Felt that rich kid pain, what it is to be alone<br>
    It's all it really is<br>
    
    <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    I was searching for something<br>
    As I watched you run<br>
    I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some<br>
    Were you looking for someone?<br>
    As I watched you go<br>
    I am mad because I don't know what you used me for<br>
    Always talking about one dayv
    In Amerika<br>
    Same old story, oh<br>
    You want glory, son<br>
    
    <h3>[Outro]</h3>
    In Amerika, in Amerika<br>
    In Amerika, in Amerika<br>
    In Amerika, in Amerika   <br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
