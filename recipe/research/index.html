        <h1>Arepas de Choclo/Sweet Corn "Cakes"  </h1>
        <p> These arepas de choclo are sweet, crunchy, chewy, corn cakes that are native to Colombia. They are perfect for breakfast or as a snack with a side of farmers cheese.
        </p>
        <p>The brief explanation of what exactly an arepa is would be to call it a corn tortilla or other grains. Many times, the main ingredient is corn, either using a dough made of fresh corn or corn flour. It has the shape of a round disc, quite flat, similar to a firm pancake. The arepas are cooked on the grill or in a frying pan.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol> <b>Place the corn, melted butter, beaten eggs, panela (or sugar) and salt in a food processor/blender and mix </b>for a couple of seconds.
        The mixture should be quite liquid and not completely soft. It's perfect if you see some larger pieces of corn.</ol>

        <ol><b>Add the mixture to a bowl, along with the corn flour. Mix with a fork</b> and <b>add</b> up to a couple of spoons of <b>milk if necessary</b>.
        The dough should be a little firmer than the pancake dough, but more liquid than the arepas or bread dough</ol>

        <ol><b>Heat the butter/oil in a frying pan. Use about 1/4 of the dough to make an arepa, </b>the size of an American pancake. <b>Cook for a couple of minutes on each side, until they are golden brown. </b>You may have to cook them in batches.</ol>

        <ol>When you have cooked the four arepas, <b>add the cheese.</b> Place cheese on top of an arepa and stack a second arepa on top, as if you were making a sandwich. Repeat for the other arepa. Place in the frying pan, lower the heat and place a lid on top until the cheese melts.</ol>

        <ol><b>Serve whole or cut into halves.</b> Serve hot with a cup of coffee, tea, chocolate or aguapanela</ol>

    <h2>Recipe Websites </h2>

    <p>I like the <a href="https://www.delishdlites.com/course/breakfast-recipes/colombian-arepas-de-choclo-griddled-sweet-corn-cakes/"> Delish Dlites</a> website because it has a nice clear use of type and the numbers are very good at guiding to the next instruction. The format of the recipe is divided clearly and the images go with one another in dividing the text. </p>

    <p>I actually like <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223400/old-school-mac-n-cheese/"> allrecipes</a> website more because the division of secions is even more prevalent and there is a very clar use of hierarchy. My only complaint about thsi site is that there is only an image of the end result but no images of the proces as the instructions go along.</p>
    <p>Although the <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/carrot-orange-ginger-soup">epicurious</a> website follows the same structure as the other two, what stands out to me is the opening frame. Having just the image with the title of the recipe is a really strong way, I think, of engaging the viewer and pulling them in without overwhelming them right away.</p>

    <h2>Other Websites</h2>
    <p> The <a href="http://www.milkychance.net"> Milky Chance</a> website is very beautiful because it uses relatively simple colors while having a lot of motion within the site. There are interactive elements as you scroll that show the band but never in the same way. Also, the use of texture creates a nice touch.</p>

    <p> The element that I really appreciate about <a href="https://whitney.org"> The Whitneys</a> website is the varied scrolling speeds as you go down the home page. That aand the slight interactive header create an interactive experience without doing to much.</p>

    <p> The <a href="https://spotify.design"> Spotify Design</a> page is also very beautifl in its interaaction as well in the varied uses of scale to highlight certain aspects of each section.</p>
