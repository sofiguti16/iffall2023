            <h3>Recipe Page</h3>
            <p> I had so much fun designing a recipe page about one of my favorite foods, arepas de choclo. I aimed to create a very simple but effective site that had a warm vibe to it. I also aimed to make the different sections clear and easy to skim so that the user could look for the bolded highlights if they need to quickly look back to find their place.

            <h3>Microsite - Designer</h3>
            <p>As a non Swiftie, I was mortified when I realized I had to stare at Taylor Swift information for an extended period of time. Luckily, my creative director had a very clear vision for what she wanted me to do. She wanted me to highlight Taylor Swifts "Eras" as well as create a small section about her life. Luckily, there is so much content on Ms. Swift the curation process was pretty easy and allowed me to play a lot with colors and typefaces.</p>

            <h3>Microsite - Creative Director</h3>
            <p> I deeply mourned the loss of my Jarritos site at first but Jordan Shonfeld was super awesome to work with. I gave him a generally fun and retroey concept where I wanted to higlight the Jarrito bottles themselves and other small elements like a general about and the JarritosXNike collaboration. I gave him create freedom with the interactive elements and he really outdid himself.</p>
